name: lint ansible playbook

# Ansible Lint is an open source project that lints your Ansible code. The docs state that it checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved. 
# It can be installed with pip and run manually on playbooks or set up in a pre-commit hook and run when you attempt a commit on your repo from the CLI.

        # Paths to ansible files (i.e., playbooks, tasks, handlers etc..)
        # or valid Ansible directories according to the Ansible role

        # Arguments to be passed to the ansible-lint
        # Options:
        #   -q                    quieter, although not silent output
        #   -p                    parseable output in the format of pep8
        #   --parseable-severity  parseable output including severity of rule
        #   -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or
        #                         more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default
        #                         rules in ansiblelint/rules, unless -R is also used.
        #   -R                    Use default rules in ansiblelint/rules in addition to
        #                         any extra
        #                         rules directories specified with -r. There is no need
        #                         to specify this if no -r flags are used
        #   -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values
        #   -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these
        #                         values
        #   --nocolor             disable colored output
        #   --exclude=EXCLUDE_PATHS
        #                         path to directories or files to skip. This option is
        #                         repeatable.
        #   -c C                  Specify configuration file to use. Defaults to ".ansible-lint"
